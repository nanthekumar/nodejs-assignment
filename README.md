A simple Node.js web application built **without** any frameworks like Express.js.  
This project demonstrates core Node.js skills — routing, serving HTML/CSS, and handling requests manually.

---

## 🛠 Features

- ✅ Basic Routing (`/`, `/about`, `/contact`)
- 🕒 Dynamic date & time displayed on homepage
- 🎨 CSS styling served from `/public` folder
- ⚠️ Custom 404 error page handling

---

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
node index.js
Then open your browser and go to:
📍 http://localhost:3000

📚 What I Learned
- Set up a raw HTTP server using Node.js core modules
- Served HTML files and replaced template tags with dynamic values
- Handled file paths using path and served static files manually
= Added basic UI styling without frontend frameworks
- Created a minimalistic web app using only built-in modules
